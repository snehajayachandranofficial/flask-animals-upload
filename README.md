\# Animals + Upload (Flask)



A tiny Flask app that demonstrates:

\- A small frontend with two boxes:

&nbsp; - Box 1: choose between Cat / Dog / Elephant (one checkbox at a time). Choosing shows a local image.

&nbsp; - Box 2: upload any file. The backend returns filename, size, and MIME type.

\- Simple Flask backend (`app.py`) with a `/upload` endpoint that measures uploaded file size without permanently saving the file.

\- Dockerfile and Procfile included for deployment to common platforms.
